Non Primitive Types

   - They are mutable types.

   - They don’t have a fixed range for value.

   - Value range changes according to memory available. 

   - They are stored in a heap memory. 

   - Heap memory can be accessed in any order. 



1. Array 

       - Arrays are used in computer programming to reduce overhead and complexity.

       - Arrays can reduce overhead by storing values in a sequential order.

       - Arrays can reduce complexity by storing multiple values under one reference name.

       - Array can handle various types of data in a sequence, however few languages can’t

         manage various types, hence they restrict array to same data type.

       - Array size can change dynamically, which is again restricted in few languages. 

       - Array refers to a sequence that allows to access in random.

Configuring Array:

       - Array configuration requires declaration by using “var” & let” and initialization by using

         “const”. 

       - It will have a keyword and reference name.



                       var   collection;

                       var   categories;

                       let    products;



        - Array requires memory allocation for handling multiple values. 

        - Memory can be allocated by using 2 techniques

                       a) Array meta character [ ]

                       b) Array constructor       Array()



        - You can initialize or assign memory



                       var categories;                           categories = [ ];            // assignment of memory



                       var categories = [ ];      // initialization of memory 



                                               (or)



                       var categories;

                       categories = new Array();      // assignment of memory



                       var categories = new Array(); // initialization of memory





   FAQ: What is difference between meta character [ ] & Array() constructor?

   Ans:  Meta character “[ ]” configures static memory. It is continuous memory. 

           Array() constructor configures dynamic memory. It is discrete memory. 



   FAQ: What is “new” ?

   Ans: It is dynamic memory allocation operator. 

           Memory is newly allocated for every request. 



Handling Data in Array:

       - You can store and read values from array memory by using a property that maps to

          its index number.

       - Property is a string type that can handle any type of value. 

       

Syntax:

           var collection = [ ];

           collection[0] = 10;         

           collection[“1”] = 20;       // ok  “1” is a property maps to 1 index in memory
