                                               JavaScript



- JavaScript is a light weight interpreted and JIT compiled programming language. 



    * Light weight refers to less memory.

    * Interpreted allows to translate line-by-line of program. 

    * Compiled allows to translate all lines simultaneously at the same time. 

    * There are 2 types of compiling techniques 

           a) JIT    [Just-In-Time]

           b) AOT    [Ahead-Of-Time]

   

    * JIT compiles on request. It loads script when requested and compiles Just-In-Time. 

    * AOT is a pre-compiled technique, where It is compiled at application level and just runs

      on request. 

    * The popular JavaScript compilers are

           a) Babel

           b) V8 

           c) Node  Compiler etc.



- JavaScript is a language that supports various programming paradigms. 

           a) Structural 

           b) Functional

           c) Imperative 

           d) Object Based etc.



- JavaScript is used as

           a) Client Side

           b) Server Side

           c) Database language

           d) Action Script



   * It is used client side with HTML.

   * It is used server side with Node & Express JS.

   * It is used in database with MongoDB.

   * It is used as action script with 2D & 3D modelling tools.



JavaScript Client Side

   - A client side script is required to reduce burden on server. 

   - It can handle interactions on client device and improve the performance of application. 

   - JavaScript client side can handle 

       a) DOM Manipulations  [Document Object Model]

               - Adding elements

               - Removing elements

               - Data Binding

               - Style Binding

               - Class Binding

               - Event Binding 

               - Model Binding etc.

       b) BOM Interactions  [Browser Object Model]

               - window

               - location

               - navigator 

               - history

               - document 

       c) Validations 



Note: Client Side interactions require JavaScript to enable in browser. 

         If JavaScript is enabled then it may help trozens in broadcasting client details to others.
