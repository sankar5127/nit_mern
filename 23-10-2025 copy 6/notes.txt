Evolution of JavaScript:

   - CERN (Council for European Research and Nuclear) labs developed a script called

     “ECMA Script” for  “Mosaic” browser.

   - Netscape Communications started a browser called “Netscape Navigator”. 

   - Netscape appointed “Brendan Eich” for developing a script for their browser. 

   - He designed a script by name “Mocha”, later renamed as “Live Script”.

   - Netscape given the responsibility of Live Script to “Sun Microsystems”.

   - Sun Microsystems and Netscape together renamed Live Script as “JavaScript”. 

   - Netscape communications stopped its services in early 2000. 

   - Netscape given the responsibility of JavaScript to “ECMA” community. 

   - Latest JavaScript ECMA Edition is 16 [June 2025].

   - The most popular versions used in various technologies

               a) ECMAScript 2016    ES6

               b) ECMAScript 2017      ES7  etc.

               

               Latest is ES16 [ECMAScript 2016 June 2025]



Issues with JavaScript:

   - It is not a strongly typed language.



             x = 10;        // number

             x = “A”;   // valid 



   - It is not implicitly strictly typed language. 



           * Strict refers to standards of coding.

           * It is required for reducing code in-consistency 

           * JavaScript requires explicit strict mode to turn on.

              “use strict”

       

   - It is not an OOP [Object Oriented] language, It is Object Based. 

           

           * Code level security issues.

           * Extensibility issues.



Note: TypeScript is an alternative for JavaScript, but not replacement. 



         Developer Writes in TypeScript => Translated into JavaScript => Browser use JavaScript.



JavaScript Integration

   - You can add JavaScript into Web page using 3 techniques

   

   1. Inline

   2. Embedded 

   3. External File 



Inline

   - JavaScript function can be defined inside any element.

   - It is faster in interactions.

   - It can’t be reused across various requests or elements. 



Syntax:

       <button onclick=“function(){}”>  



Ex:

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">

<head>

    <meta charset="UTF-8">

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <title>Document</title>

</head>

<body>

    <h2>Ticket</h2>

    <button onclick="window.print()">Print</button>

</body>

</html>



Embedded 

   - JavaScript functions can be defined in  <script> container.

   - You can embed <script> in head or body section.

   - Script in head will save round trip. 

   - It is easy to reuse, with in the page. 



Syntax:

       <head>

           <script>

               … function …

           </script>

       </head>



Ex:

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">

<head>

    <meta charset="UTF-8">

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <title>Document</title>

    <script>

        function PrintPage(){

            window.print();

        }

    </script>

</head>

<body>

    <h2>Ticket</h2>

    <button onclick="PrintPage()">Print</button>

</body>

</html>



   - JavaScript comprises of various MIME types



               text/javascript             for interpreter in browser 

               module                         for ES Module system in browser 

               text/babel                      for babel as compile 



   Note: The default is “text/javascript” 



Syntax:

               <script type=“text/javascript”>



               </script>



       - JavaScript requires strict mode to turn on explicitly by using “use strict”.



               <script type=“text/javascript”>

                   “use strict”;

   

                    … functions ….



               </script>

   

       - JavaScript code can be targeted to legacy browsers by enclosing in HTML comments.



               <!--

                   .. function ..

               -->



Ex:

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">

<head>

    <meta charset="UTF-8">

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <title>Document</title>

    <script type="text/javascript">

        "use strict";

        <!--

         function PrintPage(){

            window.print();

        }    

        -->

    </script>

</head>

<body>

    <h2>Ticket</h2>

    <button onclick="PrintPage()">Print</button>

</body>

</html>



External File

       - JavaScript functions can be defined in a separated script file with extension “.js” 

       - You can reuse across multiple pages. 

       - Using an external file will increase the number of request and also page load time. 

       - You can minify the JavaScript file and use for production. 



Ex:

1. Src/scripts/print.js



       "use strict";

function PrintPage(){

    window.print();

}



2. Js-examples/home.html



<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">

<head>

    <meta charset="UTF-8">

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <title>Document</title>

    <script src="../src/scripts/print.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

</head>

<body>

    <h2>Ticket</h2>

    <button onclick="PrintPage()">Print</button>

</body>

</html>
