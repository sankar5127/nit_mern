Variables

 - Variables are storage locations in memory, where you can store a value and use it as a part of any expression. 

 - Variable configuration comprises of 

   

               keyWord     variableName  =  value;



 - “KeyWord” defines the behaviour of variable. 

 - Using a keyword for variable is not mandatory if JavaScript is not in strict mode. 

 - JavaScript variables are configured using following keywords

           a) var

           b) let 

           c) const 

 - Variable configuration comprises of 3 phases 

           a) Declaration

           b) Assignment 

           c) Initialization 

 - Declaration comprises of keyword and variable name.

       

           var price; 



  - Assignment is the process of assigning a value into variable after declaring. 



            var price;            // declaring 

            price=4500;        // assigning 



  - Initialization is the process of configuring a value into variable while declaring.



            var price = 45000;    // initialization 

            price = 56000;          // assignment 



FAQ: What is difference between var, let & const? 

Ans:

   var:

           - It configures a function scope variable. 

           - A function scope variable can be declared in any block of a function and can be 

             accessed from any another block in the same function. 

           - It allows declaring, assignment and initializaiton.

           - It allows shadowing.

           - Shadowing is the process of re-declaring or re-initializing same name identifier within

             the scope. 



                       {

                           var y;          // declaring 

                           y = 10;        // assigning 

                           y = 20;        // assigning 

                           var y = 30; // shadowing 

                       }                          

Ex:

<script>

    function f1()

    {

        var x;          // declaring

        x = 10;         // assigning 

        if(x==10){

            var y = 20; //initialization

            y = 30;

            var y = 40;    // shadowing 

        }

        document.write("X=" + x + "<br>Y=" + y);

    }

    f1();

</script>



               - It allows Hoisting. 

               - It allows to use and declare variables without any order dependency. 

Ex:

<script>

    "use strict";

    function f1()

    {

        x = 10;

        document.write("x=" + x);

        var x;  // hoisting

    }

    f1();

</script>



   let:

       - It is used to configure a block scope variable. 

       - Block scope allows to access in the same block and in its inner blocks. 

       - This mechanism is known as “Closure”.

       - It allows declaring, assignment and initialization. 

       - It will not allow shadowing & hoisting. 

Ex:

<script>

    "use strict";

    function f1()

    {

        let x;   // declaring

        x = 10;  // assigning 

        if(x==10){

            let y = 20;  // initialization

            y = 30; // assigning

            document.write("X=" + x + "<br>Y=" + y);

        }

        

    }

    f1();

</script>



   const:     

       - It configures a block scope variable. 

       - It allows only initialization. 

       - It will not allow declaring and assigning. 

       - It will not allow shadowing and hoisting. 

   

   Syntax:

           const x;        // invalid     initialization missing 

           

           const x = 10;

           x = 20;         // invalid     can’t assign to a constant 



   Note: Constant is not readonly. A constant keeps the value constant across multiple              requests. However it can change using re-initialization. 



 Global Variable:

   - Global scope defines a module scope, which is accessible to all functions. 

   - You can configure a global variable using var, let or const. 

   - You can define a variable inside function and make it global in access by using “window”

      object of browser. 

   - It is possible only when JavaScript is used with BOM. [Browser Object Model]



Ex:

<script>

    "use strict";

    var x = 10;

    let y = 20;

    const z = 30;

    function f1()

    {

        window.a=40;

        document.write("f1 x=" + x + "y=" + y + "z=" + z + "a=" + a + "<br>");

    }

    function f2()

    {

        document.write("f2 x=" + x + "y=" + y + "z=" + z + "a=" + a + "<br>");

    }

    f1();

    f2();

</script>
